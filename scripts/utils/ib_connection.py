# STRATEGY: Use clientId=0 (master) by default for full order control.
# Only use unique IDs when concurrent connections are required.
#
# clientId=0 (MASTER):
#   - Can cancel/modify ANY order (including TWS-placed orders)
#   - Full account visibility
#   - Only ONE connection can use clientId=0 at a time
#
# clientId=1-999:
#   - Can only manage orders placed with same clientId
#   - Multiple concurrent connections allowed
#   - Use for long-running services (streaming, monitoring)
