## Guard Decision Logic

```
BUY anything              → ALLOW (no short exposure)
SELL put                  → ALLOW (cash-secured, defined risk)
Combo: BUY C + SELL C     → ALLOW (vertical spread)
Combo: BUY C + SELL P     → ALLOW (risk reversal — defined)
Combo: SELL C + BUY P     → ⚠ GAP (synthetic short — naked call)
SELL call, no stock       → BLOCK (naked short call)
SELL call, insufficient   → BLOCK (short a tail)
SELL stock, no shares     → BLOCK (naked short stock)
SELL stock, qty > held    → BLOCK (oversell)
```

## Guard Gaps

### Long Risk Reversal
**Legs:** BUY CALL (higher) + SELL PUT (lower)
**Guard says:** ALLOW (incorrectly)
**Gap:** CRITICAL GAP: Risk reversal (bullish) has unlimited loss on the short put side if underlying crashes. However, guard allows because it detects both BUY and SELL legs. The short put creates undefined risk that is NOT offset by a long call at a different strike. Guard logic is insufficient for asymmetric risk reversal.

### Jade Lizard
**Legs:** SELL CALL (higher) + BUY CALL (highest) + SELL PUT (lower) + BUY PUT (lowest)
**Guard says:** ALLOW (incorrectly)
**Gap:** CRITICAL GAP: Jade Lizard is defined-gap (no stock), and involves SELL call + SELL put. While guard detects BUY + SELL, it does not verify that the BUY legs are sufficient to cover the SELL legs at ALL price levels. A Jade Lizard with wide SELL strikes may create naked exposure if underlying breaks the long call or long put strikes.

### Seagull Spread
**Legs:** BUY CALL (highest) + SELL CALL (middle) + SELL PUT (lowest)
**Guard says:** ALLOW (incorrectly)
**Gap:** CRITICAL GAP: Seagull has a short put with no hedge. The short call is covered by the long call, but the short put is naked. Guard allows because it detects both BUY and SELL, but does not verify that each SELL leg has a corresponding BUY leg of sufficient width.
