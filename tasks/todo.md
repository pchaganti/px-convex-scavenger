## Session: Real-Time Option Contract Price Subscriptions (2026-03-03)

### Problem
IB realtime WS server only subscribed to stock contracts (`ib.contract.stock()`), so options positions (bear put spreads, bull call spreads, short puts) never received real-time price updates.

### Solution
Composite key scheme: stock prices keyed by ticker (`"AAPL"`), option prices by `{SYMBOL}_{YYYYMMDD}_{STRIKE}_{RIGHT}` (e.g., `"EWY_20260417_42_P"`). Both coexist in the same `Record<string, PriceData>` map.

### Checklist
- [x] Add shared types & utilities (`web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`): `OptionContract`, `optionKey()`, `contractsKey()`, `portfolioLegToContract()`
- [x] Update IB server (`scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`): `normalizeContracts()`, refactored `startLiveSubscription(key, ibContract)`, option subscribe handler via `ib.contract.option()`
- [x] Update client hook (`web/lib/usePrices.ts`): `contracts` option, `contractHash` memoization, contracts in subscribe message
- [x] Extract contracts from portfolio (`web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`): `portfolioContracts` useMemo iterates non-Stock legs
- [x] Display real-time option prices (`web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`): `legPriceKey()`, real-time MV/daily-change for options, `LegRow` with WS prices

### Files Modified
- `web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`
- `scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`
- `web/lib/usePrices.ts`
- `web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`
- `web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`

### Review
- TypeScript compilation passes (no errors in modified files)
- Server syntax check passes (`node --check`)
- Backward compatible: stock subscriptions unchanged, option contracts are additive

## Session: Remote IBC Control + Cloud Hosting Research (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Capture current local IBC architecture and control points) depends_on: []
- T2 (Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Compare options and select recommendation ordering) depends_on: [T2, T3]
- T5 (Document implementation plan and review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Capture current local IBC architecture and control points
- [x] T2 Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone
- [x] T3 Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints
- [x] T4 Compare options and select recommendation ordering
- [x] T5 Document implementation plan and review notes

### Review
- Verified the active local service is the machine-global `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent, not the legacy repo-local `com.radon.ibc-gateway` path.
- Verified live control wrappers exist at `~/ibc/bin/start-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `stop-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `restart-secure-ibc-service.sh`, and `status-secure-ibc-service.sh`; each is a thin `launchctl` wrapper against `gui/$UID/local.ibc-gateway`.
- Verified the active runner `~/ibc/bin/run-secure-ibc-gateway.sh` loads credentials from macOS Keychain, writes a temporary `0600` runtime IBC config, and launches `ibcstart.sh` in Gateway mode.
- Best local remote-control recommendation: keep IBC on the Mac, add a private control plane over Tailscale, and trigger only the existing wrapper scripts remotely. Best UX variant is a small status/start/stop web endpoint exposed via Tailscale Serve and locked to the tailnet; lowest-effort variant is SSH over Tailscale from iPhone.
- Best cloud recommendation: move to a dedicated private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC, accessed only over VPN/private network. This remains operationally viable but outside IBKR's supported headless model, so weekly Sunday re-auth and strict network isolation remain mandatory.
- Secondary cloud options: QuantRocket if a broader managed IB stack is desirable; community Docker images only for operators already comfortable with containers, persistence, and private networking.

- Included current local machine observations in the report: `local.ibc-gateway` running and LaunchAgent modified timestamp `2026-03-10 08:04 AM PDT`.
- Verified key content markers via `rg`.
- Opened the report locally with `open`.

## Session: Phase 1 Remote IBC Access Implementation (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac) depends_on: []
- T2 (Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac
- [x] T2 Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers
- [x] T3 Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report
- [x] T4 Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps

### Review
- Verified the current Phase 1 shape uses standard macOS SSH over the Tailscale network, not Tailscale SSH server mode, because this Mac has the GUI app variant of Tailscale installed.
- Verified the canonical IBC service surface is the secure machine-local wrapper set in `~/ibc/bin/`; repo automation is documented as a convenience wrapper only.
- Added `scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` as a repo-local helper for `check`, `tailscale-status`, `tailscale-login`, `ibc-status`, `ibc-start`, `ibc-stop`, `ibc-restart`, and `remote-help`.
- Added `docs/ibc-remote-access.md` as the durable markdown reference and linked it to `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html`.
- Added `tasks/lessons.md` to capture the correction that the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the canonical service surface.
- Validation:
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh check` confirmed Tailscale is connected, macOS SSH is enabled, and `local.ibc-gateway` is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh ibc-status` confirmed the secure `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints both direct secure-service SSH commands and the optional repo convenience wrapper commands.
  - `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 22` confirmed the SSH listener is active.
  - Public-key SSH is not configured yet because `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is absent; Phase 1 will therefore be password-based from the iPhone unless a client key is added later.
- Remaining optional step:
  - Add a dedicated SSH public key for the iPhone client if you want key-based login instead of password auth.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inventory current Phase 1 files and documentation touchpoints) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update canonical docs with the working SSH-over-Tailscale flow and dependencies) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Validate docs and helper behavior against the live machine state) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Commit only the relevant files) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Push the commit to the current branch remote) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inventory current Phase 1 files and documentation touchpoints
- [x] T2 Update canonical docs with the working SSH-over-Tailscale flow and dependencies
- [x] T3 Validate docs and helper behavior against the live machine state
- [x] T4 Commit only the relevant files
- [x] T5 Push the commit to the current branch remote

### Review
- Reworked `README.md` to match the requested structure from the shared review: cleaner summary, badges, explicit Inputs/Processing/Outputs, three-gate framework, strategy matrix, architecture diagram, grouped commands, simplified data-source/testing sections, example workflow, and the Phase 1 remote IBC dependency block.
- Updated the authoritative IBC docs in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/implement.md`, and `docs/ib_tws_api.md` so the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the primary surface and the old `scripts/setup_ibc.sh` flow is clearly legacy.
- Preserved and linked the Phase 1 remote-access runbook in `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`, including the concrete dependencies required for iPhone control:
  - `Tailscale.app` on the Mac
  - Tailscale on the iPhone, connected to the same tailnet
  - macOS `Remote Login`
  - iPhone SSH client such as Termius, Blink Shell, or Prompt
  - Optional SSH public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for key-based login
- Validation:
  - `bash -n scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` passed.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints the direct secure-service SSH commands and optional helper commands.
  - User confirmed iPhone SSH login works in Termius with password auth.
  - Commit: `bf86cc4` (`docs: refresh README and document secure IBC remote access`)
  - Push: `origin/main` updated on `2026-03-10`

- T2 (Rewrite README structure and preserve the secure IBC Phase 1 dependencies) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Verify the refreshed README still points to the durable runbook and report artifacts) depends_on: [T2]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Compare README against the shared rewrite outline and current repo reality
- [x] T2 Rewrite README structure and preserve the secure IBC Phase 1 dependencies
- [x] T3 Verify the refreshed README still points to the durable runbook and report artifacts

### Review
- Reworked `README.md` around a clearer public-facing hierarchy: summary, What Radon Does, trade validation framework, strategies, architecture, quick start, terminal, grouped commands, project structure, data sources, testing, and services.
- Preserved the Phase 1 secure local IBC path in the README Services section, including the concrete dependencies for Tailscale, macOS Remote Login, and iPhone SSH clients.
- Added direct references from the README to the durable markdown runbook `docs/ibc-remote-access.md` and the preserved HTML report `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html`.
- Verification:
  - `rg -n "What Radon Does|Trade Validation Framework|System Architecture|Quick Start|Radon Terminal|CLI Commands|Phase 1 Remote IBC Access" README.md`
  - Manual README review against the shared outline confirmed the requested structural sections are present.

- T7 (Validate cloud persistence, secrets, restart behavior, and Sunday re-auth runbook) depends_on: [T6]
- T8 (Decide primary operating model and cut over to the preferred steady-state path) depends_on: [T5, T7]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Preserve the research baseline, report, and canonical secure local service surface
  - Success criteria:
    - `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` remains the durable comparison artifact.
    - The canonical service surface is documented everywhere as `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh`.
- [x] T2 Complete Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access and documentation
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone can connect to the Mac over Tailscale and run the secure IBC commands.
    - README and runbook document the dependencies and direct command flow.
- [ ] T3 Harden local remote access with key-based SSH and tighter SSH policy
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone SSH client uses a dedicated key instead of password auth.
    - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` contains the intended client key only.
    - SSH config is reviewed so remote access remains limited to the Tailscale path and expected auth methods.
- [ ] T4 Build Phase 2 private web controller over Tailscale for start/stop/status/restart
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - A minimal private controller runs only on the Mac.
    - It exposes `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` for the secure local IBC service.
    - Access is restricted to the tailnet and does not expose IB API or IBC command ports publicly.
- [ ] T5 Add local resilience: health checks, alerting, and away-from-desk power/sleep policy
  - depends_on: [T3, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an operator-visible health signal for IBC reachability and launchd state.
    - Failure notifications or a simple alert path exist for the local service.
    - The machine’s sleep/power behavior is documented so remote control is reliable while away.
- [ ] T6 Stand up a private cloud IBC proof of concept on a Linux VM
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private Linux VM runs IB Gateway + IBC with no public IB or VNC exposure.
    - Access is limited to Tailscale or equivalent private networking.
    - Secrets and persistent Gateway state are stored outside ad hoc local files.
- [ ] T7 Validate cloud persistence, secrets, restart behavior, and Sunday re-auth runbook
  - depends_on: [T6]
  - Success criteria:
    - The VM survives restart/redeploy without losing required Gateway/IBC state.
    - Weekly Sunday re-auth and recovery steps are documented and tested.
    - Burn-in covers reconnects, restart cadence, and failure handling for at least one trading week.
- [ ] T8 Decide primary operating model and cut over to the preferred steady-state path
  - depends_on: [T5, T7]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an explicit decision between Mac-hosted primary and cloud-hosted primary.
    - The non-primary path is documented as fallback.
    - Final operator runbooks point to one canonical daily-use workflow.

### Review
- This session converts the prior research into an explicit end-to-end rollout instead of stopping at Phase 1.
- Current completed state:
  - Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access is working from the iPhone.
  - The secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers are the canonical service surface.
  - The durable research and reference artifacts already exist in `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` and `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`.
- Remaining delivery is now split cleanly into two tracks:
  - Local track: SSH hardening, private web control plane, operational resilience.
  - Cloud track: private VM proof of concept, burn-in, and cutover decision.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision) depends_on: []
- T2 (Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary) depends_on: [T2, T4]

### Checklist
- [ ] T1 Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision
  - depends_on: []
  - Success criteria:
    - A dedicated iPhone SSH public key is installed in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    - The preferred auth mode and remote-access policy are documented for the Mac.
    - A reachability policy is chosen and documented: keep-awake, wake relay, or accepted sleep limitation.

- [ ] T2 Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private controller is reachable only from the tailnet.
    - The iPhone flow supports `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` without shell interaction.
    - Basic health, recent logs, and failure feedback are visible remotely.

- [ ] T3 Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private VM is provisioned with IB Gateway + IBC, Tailscale, persisted config/state, and secrets handling.
    - No IB API, IBC, VNC, or controller ports are exposed publicly.
    - Recovery access is defined for the VM when Gateway needs manual intervention.

- [ ] T4 Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring
  - depends_on: [T3]
  - Success criteria:
    - The cloud pilot survives a multi-day burn-in with successful reconnect behavior.
    - The Sunday re-auth and failure-recovery runbook is documented and validated.
    - Monitoring and log collection are sufficient to detect disconnects or stuck sessions.

- [ ] T5 Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary
  - depends_on: [T2, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - A primary deployment model is chosen: local Mac with private controller, cloud VM, or cloud pilot only.
    - Rollback and failover steps are documented for whichever model is selected.
    - The durable docs and future runbooks are updated to reflect the chosen operating model.

### Review
- Phase 1 is complete and operational: password-based macOS SSH over Tailscale to the secure `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers.
- The next local step is hardening, not replacing, the current path: add key-based SSH and make the Mac reachability policy explicit.
- The private web controller is the best Phase 3 UX improvement because it keeps the canonical service surface intact while removing the need for shell interaction on the phone.
- The cloud track should be treated as a pilot until a burn-in validates restart behavior, Sunday re-auth handling, and recovery procedures.
- If the cloud pilot remains operationally weaker than the local Mac because of IBKR auth friction, keep the local deployment as primary and treat cloud as a secondary or recovery path.
